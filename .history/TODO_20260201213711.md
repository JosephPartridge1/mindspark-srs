# Restore UI to Functional State

## Backend Simplification
- [x] Simplify app.py to only include required endpoints: GET /api/next-word, POST /api/submit-answer, GET /api/stats
- [x] Create simple database.py with SQLite connection and check_same_thread=False
- [x] Simplify srs_algorithm.py to basic SRS logic

## Frontend Verification
- [ ] Verify templates/index.html is single page with required elements
- [ ] Verify static/css/style.css has futuristic minimal styling
- [ ] Verify static/js/app.js handles fetch, submit, update UI correctly
- [ ] Ensure requirements.txt has flask, flask-cors

## Testing
- [ ] Test that python app.py runs and serves the UI
- [ ] Verify typing exercise functionality works
- [ ] Check API endpoints respond correctly
